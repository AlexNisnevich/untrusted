**Untrusted —or— the Continuing Adventures of Dr. Eval** is an exciting Meta-Javascript Adventure Game wherein you guide the dashing, steadfast Dr. Eval through a mysterious MACHINE CONTINUUM, wherein, using only his trusty computer and the TURING-COMPLETE power of Javascript, he must literally ALTER HIS REALITY in order to find his freedom! You must literally edit and re-execute the very Javascript running the game in your browser to save Dr. Eval from this dark and confusing reality!

### Overview

The game presents you with a roguelike-like playing environment and a console window  with the JavaScript code generating each level. As loaded, each level is unbeatable, and most of the JavaScript is blocked from editing. The challenge is to open a path to the next level using only the limited tools left open to you.

### Development

Run
```
make
```
to merge the JavaScript files into `scripts/build/untrusted.js` (and enables debug features).

```
make release
```
merges and minifies the JavaScript files into `scripts/build/untrusted.min.js` (and disables debug features).

To run the game locally, you need to set up a local server to serve `index.html` (this step is necessary due to Access-Control-Allow-Origin restrictions).

First install [http-server](https://github.com/nodeapps/http-server/#installing-globally) if you haven't already:

```
sudo npm install http-server
```

Then run:

```
make runlocal
```

Build your own mod in the `mods` directory:

```
make mod=example_mod
```

### Contributing Levels

To add a new level, create a jsx file in [/levels/bonus](https://github.com/AlexNisnevich/untrusted/tree/master/levels/bonus) and add the level filename to the `bonusLevels` array in [game.js](https://github.com/AlexNisnevich/untrusted/blob/master/scripts/game.js#L40).

If you are adding any new commands that the player can use, make sure to add them to `reference.js`.

#### The .jsx file format

jsx files are like regular JavaScript files, but have some additional syntax:
- `#BEGIN_EDITABLE#` and `#END_EDITABLE#` surround editable lines
- `#{#` and `#}#` wrap editable sections (parts of lines)
- `#BEGIN_PROPERTIES#` and `#END_PROPERTIES#` surround the properties object at the start of the file. Available properties include:
  - `commandsIntroduced`: array of new commands introduced in the level (see `reference.js`)
  - `mapProperties`: optionally contains any of the following:
     - `allowOverwrite`: if true, placed static objects can be overwritten by other objects
     - `keyDelay`: specifies the lag, in milliseconds, between player keystrokes (default: 0)
     - `quickValidateCallback`: speeds up validation of callback methods at the cost of some security (useful for levels with very many dynamic objects)
     - `refreshRate`: the refresh rate of the level, in milliseconds (required for dynamic objects with `interval` properties to work correctly)
     - `showDrawingCanvas`: if true, the drawing canvas overlay is displayed
     - `showDummyDom`: if true, a dummy DOM will be displayed instead of the regular map
  - `music`: name of the background track for the level (see `music.js`) 
  - `startingMessage`: message displayed at the bottom of the screen when the level starts (if any)
  - `version`: increase the level version whenever you update a level
- `#START_OF_START_LEVEL#` and `#END_OF_START_LEVEL#` should be the first and last line of the `startLevel` method, respectively
