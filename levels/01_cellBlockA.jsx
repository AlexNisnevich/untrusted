 *
 * Good morning, Dr. Eval.
 *
 * It wasn't easy, but I've managed to get your computer down
 * to you. This system might be unfamiliar, but the underlying
 * code is still JavaScript. Just like we predicted.
 *
 * Now, let's get what we came here for and then get you out of
 * here. Easy peasy.
 *
 * I've given you as much access to their code as I could, but
 * it's not perfect. The red background indicates lines that
 * are off-limits from editing.
 *
 * The code currently places blocks in a rectangle surrounding
 * you. All you need to do is make a gap. You don't even need
 * to do anything extra. In fact, you should be doing less.
