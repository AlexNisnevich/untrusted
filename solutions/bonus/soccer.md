## kedilayanaveen10: Freeze the defence like Messi!
Redefine the enemy players' and goalie's movement function and score a goal using the telephone.
```javascript
moveEnemyPlayer = function(){}
moveGoalie = function(){}
```
## Pppery: Block the Goalie
```
map.placeObject(41, 13, "block");
```
Move the ball in one direction to force to goalie to commit to that side, then move the ball in the other direction and kick it. Eventually the enemyPlayers will move out of the way.
