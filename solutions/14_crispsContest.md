## Script Injection (Rudedog9d)

This method makes the green locks passable, no matter what. It was interesting to make this work out, as there is a very limited set of characters to work with. The part of interest is: `greenKey');}return false;if(''){('`

Basically, finish the `if` the statement, make the green locks always passable if the key doesn't exist, then add a bogus `if` statement to make it syntatically correct. (the `('')` doesn't really make sense, but it's what we had to work with :P)

Path to follow:

- Go through upper-left labrynth, get **yellow** key
- Go through upper-right labrynth, get **blue** key
- Go through bottom labrynth, get **algorithm**

```js
map.defineObject('greenLock', {
        'symbol': String.fromCharCode(0x2297),
        'color': '#0f0',
        'impassable': function (player) {
            if (player.hasItem('greenKey')) {
                player.removeItem('greenKey');}return false;if(''){('');
                return false;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
        }
    });
```

            if (player.hasItem('greenKey')) {
                player.removeItem('theAlgorithm');
                return false;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
```

```javascript
        'impassable': function (player) {
            if (player.hasItem('greenKey')) {
                player.removeItem('greenKey');map.placeObject(24,9,'greenKey');
                return false;
            } else {
                return true;
            }
```

*Note: this solution no longer works as of version 1.2 of this level.*

Let's call the cells from the top to the bottom and from left to right 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8 and the one in which the player starts C:
 * C -> 3
 * 3 -> 1
 * 1 -> C
 * C -> 2
 * 2 -> 4
 * 4 -> C
 * C -> 7 (Algorithm)
 * 7 -> 8
 * 8 -> C
 * C -> Exit

```javascript
player.removeItem('yellowLock');
```

## Try luck

```javascript
'impassable': function (player) {
    if (player.hasItem('greenKey')) {
        player.removeItem('' || Math.random() < .5? 'greenKey' : 'blueKey' + '');
        return false;
    } else {
        return true;
    }
}
```

Steps:

1. Go to the top-right corner. Path: red lock -> get blue key -> green lock -> get red key -> red lock.
2. Go to the top-left corner. Path: blue lock -> get yellow key -> green lock -> get blue key -> blue lock.
3. Go to bottom. Path: yellow lock -> get yellow key -> blue lock -> get algorithm -> yellow lock.
4. Exit!

We must be lucky enough to remove blue key at first green lock and remove green key at second green lock. If the lock doesn't remove expected key, restart game. Ideally, we have 25% chance to pass this level.

        }
    });
```
Go up through the blue lock to get the blue key. Come down through green, grab the yellow key, and out through blue. Now go down through yellow on the bottom left, grab the A, through the blue lock, grab the yellow key, and up through the yellow lock.
